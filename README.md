# Machine Learning Based Lightweight Intrusion Detection System for IoT

## Overview
This project implements a **Lightweight Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for the **Internet of Things (IoT)** using **Machine Learning techniques**.  
It is designed to efficiently detect and classify network intrusions while minimizing computational and memory usage — ideal for IoT devices.
